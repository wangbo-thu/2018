> "Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you -- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."

>  "Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"
>
>  For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...

> "Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."



> *Chapter 11*
>
> "I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much?"



> *Chapter 12*
>
> "What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.
>
> "I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.
>
> "Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
>
> "So that I may forget," replied the tippler.
>
> "Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.
>
> "Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
>
> "Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.
>
> "Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.
>
> And the little prince went away, puzzled.



> *Chapter 13*
>
> "And what good does it do you to own the stars?"
>
> "It does me the good of making me rich."
>
> "And what good does it do you to be rich?"
>
> "It makes it possible for me to buys more stars, if any are discovered."
>
> "This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."



> *Chapter 14*
>
> "It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."
>
> "There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
>
> As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders.
>
> For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.
>
> "That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."



> *Chapter 17*
>
> When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth.
>
> "Where are the men?" the little prince at last took up the conversation again. "It is a little lonely in the desert..."
>
> "It is also lonely among men," the snake said.



> *Chapter 18*
>
> "Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."



> *Chapter 19*
>
> And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak...



> *Chapter 21*
>
> 这一章实在是太美了，驯服、仪式感、为狐狸难过，教小王子如何去爱。
>
> What does that mean--'tame'?
>
> "It is an act too often neglected," said the fox, "It means to  establish ties." 
>
> "To establish ties?"
>
> "Just that," said the fox, "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."
>
> "I am beginning to understand," said the little prince, "There's a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
>
> "My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me,it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat..."
>
> The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.
>
> "Please--tame me!" he said.
>
> "I want to, very much," the little prince replied. But I have not much time.
>
> I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
>
> "One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."
>
> "It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
>
> "What is a rite?" asked the little prince. 
>
> "Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox.
>
> "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
>
> So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near--
>
> "Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry."
>
> "It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
>
> "Yes, that is so," said the fox.
>
> "But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince.
>
> "Yes, that is so," said the fox.
>
> "Then it has done you no good at all!"
>
> "It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:
>
> "Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye tome, and I will make you a present of a secret."
>
> "Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
>
> "What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
>
> "It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
>
> "It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.
>
> "Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."
>
> "I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.



> *Chapter 22*
>
> "Only the children know what they are looking for," said the little prince. "They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry..."



> *Chapter 23*
>
> "It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend..."
>
> "The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
>
> "What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
>
> "Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"



> *Chapter 25*
>
> "Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
>
> And the little prince added: "But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."



### 思考

这是第三次看这本书了吧，依旧能有诸多体会，每次看的心情可能都不相同，故事的最后，有种很轻微的伤感，放佛与老朋友离别时常有的情绪。小王子已成为我生活中的一部分，从第一次阅读对驯服的赞叹，开始喜欢落日，不高兴的时候犹是，喜欢在夜间看星空闪耀。
