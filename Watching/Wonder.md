### 台词
> Is he one of those kids that acts one way in front of grownups and then another way in front of kids?
> Yeah, I guess.
> Well I know it's hard, but you have to understand that. He probably feels badly about himself. And when someone acts small, you just have to be the bigger person, all right?
> Right.

> If someone pushes you, push back. Don't be afraid of anyone.

> "Why do I  have to be so ugly?"
> "You are not ugly, Auggie."
> "You just have to say that because you are my mom."
> "Oh, because I'm your mom, it doesn't count?"
> "Yeah"
> "Because I'm your mom, it counts the most because I know you the most. You are not ugly and anyone who cares to know you will see that."
> "They won't talk to me. It matters that I look different. I try to pretend that it doesn't, but it does."
> "I know."
> "Is it always gonna matter?"
> "I don't know."
> Honey, listen... Look at me. We all have marks on our face. I have this wrinkle here from your first surgery. I have these wrinkles here from your last surgery. This is the map that shows us where we're going. And this is the map that shows us where we've been. And it's never ever ugly.

> Mom and Dad would always say I was the most understanding girl in the world. I don't know about that. I just knew my family couldn't take one more thing.

> You ever thought about having plastic surgery?
> No, I've never thought about it. Why? Dude, this is after plastic surgery! It takes a lot of work to look this good.

> Dear Mr. Tushman, I'm very sorry for punching Julian. It was wrong of me to do that. I know you may need to expel me, but I'd still rather not say why I did what I did. It might get Julian in trouble, too, and that's not fair. Sincerely, Jack Will.
> Dear Mr. Will, one thing I've learned in 20 years in education is that there are two sides to every story. So I think I can imagine what started the fight while nothing justifies striking another student. I know good friends are worth defending. So, after your 2-day suspension your scholarship will be waiting for you. Just keep up the good work. And keep being the fine boy we all know you to be. Sincerely, Mr. Tushman.



> You've come a long way, huh? - Yeah.
>
> Auggie, I am proud of you for sticking it out.
>
> You didn't think I would, did you?
>
> 'Course I did.
>
> Okay, well, come on. I mean, when you started you were still wearing the astronaut helmet in public.
>
> I love that helmet. I wish I knew where it was.
>
> It's in my office.
>
> What? Dad! That was a gift. You had no right to hide it!
>
> Auggie, Auggie, please, don't be mad. You gotta understand, you were wearing it all the time. I never got to see you anymore. I missed your face. I know you don't always like it, but I love it. It's my son's face. I wanna see it. Do you forgive me?
>
> No. Yes.



> Then again, maybe that's kind of the point. Maybe the truth is, I'm really not so ordinary. Maybe if we knew what other people were thinking, we'd know that no one's ordinary. And we all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives.



> Be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. And if you really wanna see what people are, all you have to do is look.
